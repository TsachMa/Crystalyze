# Crystalyze Repository

This repository contains the code and resources for the Crystalyze project.

## Overview

Crystalyze is a machine learning model that combines XRD representation learning with a crystal diffusion variational autoencoder (CDVAE) to generate crytal structures given an x-ray diffraction pattern. 

## Installation

To use Crystalyze, follow these steps:

1. conda env create -f env_sub.yml
2. conda activate crystalyze
3. pip install -e .

## Usage

To train and use the Crystalyze, refer to the following instructions:
